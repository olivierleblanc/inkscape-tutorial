TODO list:

## Repository Structure

The repository contains a couple of drawing examples made with Inkscape.

## Install TexText

You will need to install [TexText](https://textext.github.io/textext/index.html) allowing you to write LaTeX mathematical equations.

## Adding new fonts

It is possible to download new fonts on your PC. After adding the fonts on your OS, they should be usable anywhere (Microsoft Word, Inskcape, ...).
We advise you to install the LaTeX font ``CMU Serif``: https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/cmu-serif.
